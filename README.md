# Polynomial-Regression-
This repository offers a detailed exploration into the application of linear regression for nonlinear fits, commonly known as polynomial regression. While the underlying principles of the model remain linear, feature engineering introduces polynomial attributes to fit more complex data patterns.


Demonstrates the concept of feature engineering with polynomial bases.
Visualizes the impact of different polynomial degrees on training and test error.
Highlights the divergence of training and test errors to illustrate overfitting.
Incorporates constraints to avoid overfitting, demonstrating a simple method to select polynomial order.
Gives insights on the potential need for advanced regularization techniques like Lasso and Ridge for more robust solutions.
